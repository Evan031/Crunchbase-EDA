Financial data regarding startup funding

My goal in this particular project was to find out more about venture capital. Funding has much more facets to it than one may think. Your industry and location alone can have a major impact on how much funding will be at your disposal. 

The data being analysed is based upon companies markets, dates, funding but most of all year and location.

To analyse the data I used Numpy and Pandas. Then I relied on matplotlib, Seaborn and plotly for visualisations and interactive graphs.

# My findings were as follows:

* Most start-ups survive and become great companies 
* The most start-ups were founded in 2011 
* USA trumps all others in sheer volume regarding the founding of start-ups 
* Software and Biotech are the leading markets 
* California has the most founded companies 
* Telecoms Verizon is the highest fund raising start-up in the world
